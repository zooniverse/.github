# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Zooniverse code as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Proposing new features
- Submitting code, which could be a fix or a feature

Note: This is a generic contributing guide. The most actively maintained Zooniverse repositories have their own, specialized contributing guide.

## Reporting bugs

### Report bugs using Github's Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. [Learn more about Github Issues](https://github.com/features/issues).

### Writing detailed bug reports

If you find a bug and want to report it, great; _thank you_. But in order for us to actually tackle it, we need plenty of information on what's going on.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Devs *love* thorough bug reports.

## Contributing code

### We develop with Github
We use [Github](https://github.com/) to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` or `master`.
2. If you've added or changed code that should be tested.
3. Update any related documentation in the codebase.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Where can I ask for help?

- Zooniverse repositories have their own Issues, Discussions, and Pull Requests.
- Our [Talk boards](https://www.zooniverse.org/talk) are another good place to talk about projects, bug reports etc.
- Visit the [Zooniverse Help](https://help.zooniverse.org) website.
- Finally, you can always email [contact@zooniverse.org](mailto:contact@zooniverse.org).
